# Judgement Day

This is a web app which allows users to upload arguments (in a hopefully objective
way) and to vote on other people's arguments to settle them.

Users earn various reputation levels for the ratio of votes they have placed correctly
(voting with the majority on arguments where voting has ended) and also how many 
arguments they have had users vote with them. On the page which all users are
displayed the user is able to order them by their statistics.

Arguments can be voted on only once per person. Once a person has voted the 
buttons to vote disappear. At this stage, arguments only require 6 votes to be
considered decided. As (if) the project gets bigger, I would scale it accordingly.
Arguments are also able to be sorted by if they are finished and a few other
factors.

## Things I Would Have Liked To Include

* 404 page
* A footer which pushes you back to the top of the page
* My own commenting system. Not a fan of Disqus
* The ability to turn arguments into dropdowns which you could hide if you chose

## Thanks!
